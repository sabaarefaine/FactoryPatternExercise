            These classes must conform to IVehicle and implement the Drive() method - which will just Console.WriteLine(“Building a new Car!”)
            Now we will make our static VehicleFactory class
            It will contain a static method GetVehicle(), that will return an IVehicle based on the amount of tires it’s given as a parameter
            Call this functionality in the Main method
